\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

In this paper, we built \h, a similarity search framework, that improves on the
PathSim. Firstly, even with the pruning algorithm that they introduce in the
paper, the original PathSim framework still requires expensive matrix
computations that are not feasible in an online setting. We introduce a better
storage mechanism, \mTable, that allows faster materialization of the meta
paths to support real-time user queries. Secondly, we built our own tree data
structure, \hTable, to allow us to perform efficient OLAP operations on the
dataset. Thirdly, we also allow users to specify constraints on the meta paths
that are used in the similarity measures.

\subsection{Future Work}

For future work, we plan to implement better search algorithm than our current
implementation. A metaheuristic optimization technique such as ant-colony
optimization algorithm~\cite{dorigo1997ant} will be better at navigating the
graph with the constraints that the user added.

Another area of future will be to make our framework more scalable by running
it in a distributed fashion. There have been previous works that implement
distributed graph processing framework such as GraphLab~\cite{low2010graphlab}
and Graphx~\cite{xin2013graphx}.

\subsection{Open Source}
