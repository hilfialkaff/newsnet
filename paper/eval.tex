\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

In this section, we begin by describing the datasets used in our experiments.
Followed with statistics of the underlying network and we finish by showing
the runtimes of the OLAP queries and Similarity Search operations on the datasets.

\subsection{Data}

We test \h on three different datasets.

The DBLP dataset is a network of Authors, Papers, Citations, Venues, and 
Terms. It is a heterogeneous network, however it does not contain any 
hierarchical entities. The total size of the data is 1.1GB, the relationship
between entities were as follow: Author$\leftrightarrow$Paper,
Paper$\leftrightarrow$Term, and Paper$\leftrightarrow$Venue.

The DBLP Hierarchical Dataset is similar to the previous one. Except, that now
the relations are as follows: Paper$\leftrightarrow$Area, Author$\leftrightarrow$Area,
Conf$\leftrightarrow$Area, Term$\leftrightarrow$Area. 
Furthermore, Area and Conf entities form a hierarchy.
This dataset is much more smaller than the previous one, only 7.9MB.

Finally, the last dataset is from the New York Times. It represents a comprehensive
dataset that is both heteregenous and also hierarchical. The network is 650MB, with
entities: Article, Location, Organization, Person, Topic. Furthermore, each one of these
entites except Article has its own hierarchy.
