\paragraph{Similarity Search:} We built our framework on top of PathSim because
most similarity measures only work for homogeneous network such
as Personalized Page-Rank~\cite{jeh2003scaling}, Sim-Rank~\cite{jeh2002simrank}
and SCAN~\cite{xu2007scan} although many of the emerging information are
heterogeneous in nature.
