\subsection*{Abstract}

With the advent of the big-data era, there have been many large-scale
heterogeneous information network that consist of multi-typed, interconnected
objects such as social media networks or news networks. Many companies have
been established to unearth patterns in such a massive dataset. One of the
operations that people have been interested is performing is similarity search.
However, most existing similarity search frameworks have been unable to support
user queries in real-time. Furthermore, users are not able to perform OLAP
operations efficiently on the data. As a result, it is not possible for user to
compute similarity measures between two objects under the contexts that the
user desires. In this paper, we propose similarity search that support both
online and OLAP queries for user.
